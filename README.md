# Reporting Tools

### Description
The tools being used in order to monitor the progress of development and be used to report our findings. These tools include:
- In-game Overlay with players real world position
- Post Game heat map of player

The in-game overlay will be used in order understand the location of the player when testing the mechanics, allowing for easier testing of an implementation.

The heat map will be generated by an external program in order to reduce the load during the game running, as well as the heat map not being very useful at runtime, however it makes a useful reporting tool of the players interaction with their real world space.

### Implementation

The in-game player map is created by using a separate plane for a player controller identical to the one within the game. A camera is placed over this which outputs to a render texture displayed on a canvas over the player camera. The secondary area is mapped directly to real world space assuming a 5x5 area.
